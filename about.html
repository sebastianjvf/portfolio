			<h1>Interests and curriculum</h1>
			<p>
				Originally, I come from Munich, Germany. After having moved to Lyon and then Paris for my studies, I am now based in Stockholm. I am interested in modern art and impressionalism (the Museé d'Orsay in Paris is still my favourite), travel and languages. I also enjoy playing Squash in my free time or going snowboarding in the Alpes and the Pyrenees.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Driven by compassion and user needs, I impact people's lives by bridging the gap between them and the products they use. I enjoy both the technological and psychological aspects of user experience design and its relation to art.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I started my journey to becoming a user experience design during my Bachelor's in Media informatics, a practice-oriented variation of a traditional computer science degree with a focus on user-centred design. I decided to specialise in user experience design and thus started my double Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction and Design at Université Paris-Saclay and KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm. I also became quite interested in cognitive and behavioural psychology.

			<h1>About this website</h1>
			<p>
				This website was greatly inspired by Scandinavia, Sweden and Stockholm, where I currently live. The main colours, royal blue and yellow, are a hint to the colours of the Swedish national flag. The wave symbol, which can be found on most pages, represents the baltic sea. In fact, the capitol of Stockholm uses the same symbol for an interactive statue indicating water quality of the sea in the bay of the city.
			</p>
			<p>
				The type used on this website is called <a href="http://monokrom.no/fonts/aften">Aften Screen</a>. It is a font developed by Norwegian typefoundry <a href="http://monokrom.no/">Monokrom</a>, inspired by older fonts used throughout Scandinavia. It was developed especially for reading on screens.
