			This website was greatly inspired by Scandinavia, Sweden and Stockholm, where I currently live. The main colours, royal blue and yellow, are a hint to the colours of the Swedish national flag. The wave symbol, which can be found on most pages, represents the baltic sea. In fact, the capitol of Stockholm uses the same symbol for an interactive statue indicating water quality of the sea in the bay of the city.
